# Project

This project is about visualizing the data from **dataset.csv** in *data* folder. The neccessary libraries are being imported.  Then, data is read from dataset.csv in data folder. Data exploration is performed.  

Data is being visualized by the following functions in *src* folder:
- 01_generate-data.py
- 02_visualize-data.py
- 03_plot-predictions.py

The visualization of the data is stored as **dataset-image.png** in *images* folder. 

Next, the data is split into training data and test data.  A Logistic Regression model is being trained.  The accurarcy is calculated.  The prediction on test data is being visualized and stored as **predictions.png** in *images* folder. 


**Report.ipynb** encapsulates the project by performing the steps above and displaying the results and visualizations accordingly.  Report.ipynb is located in *reports* folder.

In the *docs* folder, you can find the weekly meetings, documents and a pdf version of the report, namely **Report.pdf**.
